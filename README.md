## ABOUT ##
To put it simply, Upalate is a nutrition app.
The app has two primary goals:

1)  A repository for personal nutrition choices, and recommendations
    for healthier eating.

2)  Global responsibility:
    Using data from the UN Division of Statistics, this app
    will trace the supply chain from a user's plate to the 
    farm.
